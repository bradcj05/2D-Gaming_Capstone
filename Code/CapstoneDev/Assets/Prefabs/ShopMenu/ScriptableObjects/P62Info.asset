  description: A rare museum piece, only two were ever produced and both were considered
    marvelous feats of aerodynamic engineering during World War II. One got sold
    off in some auction, and the other somehow got to Commander Jones, who then used
    it as a training plane in his base. Remarkably maneuverable, but the project
    was canceled before weapons could be made for it. Until some navy dude slapped
    a machinegun on out of frustration.
